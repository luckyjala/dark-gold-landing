Dark + Gold Cinematic Landing - Ready to run

How to run:
1. Unzip this package.
2. Upload to Replit (HTML/CSS/JS) or push to a GitHub repo and deploy with Vercel/Netlify.
3. The project includes an embedded audio file at audio/ambient_loop.mp3 - replace if desired.

Next steps I can help with:
- Replace the audio file with the hosted optimized loop I can provide.
- Add real gallery images and content.
- Deploy to GitHub + Vercel and give you the live link.
